                <p class="">I usually prototype with tools like Figma, GIMP, and Inkscape. I try to keep my designs simple, as I feel they convey messages the best.</p>

                <p class="blurb1">My interest in programming started at about 9 years old, when I wanted to make my own Minecraft mod. Although 4th grade me never quite figured out Java my curiosity for technology never went away. I kept learning about general concepts relating to systems, languages, and networking.
</p>
                <p class="">After starting photography and finding a passion in composition and design I switched largely to web development. The element of coding I enjoy most is the constant need to learn new concepts and ideas.</p>
