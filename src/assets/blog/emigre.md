&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is mostly just a test of my blog page, but I figured I'd still write about one my biggest inspirations, Emigre Magazine. Emigre Magazine was published from 1984 to 2005, with issues focusing largely on graphic design. The in-house designed typefaces were an integral part of every issue, and 1986 Emigre would start licensing them. Digital copies of every issue are available online, on both the Letterform Archive and archive.org.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each edition of Emigre has a truly unique aesthetic, from #1's scrappy punk look, to #44's museum-like uniformity. It's near impossible to pick a 'best' issue, but #32, entitled "Essays, Texts and Other Writings about Graphic Design‚Äù, is a contender. It features the perfect mix of uniform design and chaos, which only increases as the magazine progresses. #32 is entirely black and white, which aids in the unfamiliar and alienating feeling it is trying to convey. If what you're looking for is a more colorful example, I recommend #13, an edition which uses the contrast between red and blue to create minimal yet striking designs.</p>
